    <h1>Demographic of WestAfrica</h1>
    <p>Advancements in DNA research have shed light on the multifaceted makeup and origins of today's African  Americans. <br> In fact, most of today's African-American population can trace their ancestry back to one of just 46 ethnic groups Three <br> Large regions of Atlantic Africa were the major contributors to the slave trade: Upper Guinea, including  the modern countries<br> Senegal, Mali, Gambia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia; Lower Guinea, including the southern portions of eastern Ivory Coast, Ghana, <br> Togo, Benin and Nigeria; and West  Central Africa,  which encompassed mostly the western portions of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola.<br> Certainly! Africa has produced many remarkable individuals who have made significant contributions to various fields. Let’s explore a few of these influential <br> personalities:
        Wangari Maathai: A renowned environmentalist from Kenya, Wangari Maathai was the first woman from East and Central Africa to earn a doctorate.<br> She founded the “Green Belt Movement,” inspiring afforestation efforts worldwide. Born in 1940, Maathai’s dedication to preserving native plant species and<br> empowering women left a lasting impact1.
        Nelson Mandela: A global symbol of resistance against apartheid, Nelson Mandela was South Africa’s first Black president.<br> His unwavering fight for justice, reconciliation, and equality earned him immense respect worldwide
    Here are the African tribes from which most of today's African Americans come.</p>
