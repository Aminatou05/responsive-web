    <p>Advancements in DNA research have shed light on the multifaceted makeup and origins of today's African Americans. In fact, most of today's African-American population can trace their ancestry back to one of just 46 ethnic groups. Three large regions of Atlantic Africa were the major contributors to the slave trade: Upper Guinea, including the modern countries of Senegal, Mali, Gambia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia; Lower Guinea, including the southern portions of eastern Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria; and West Central Africa, 
      which encompassed mostly the western portions of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola.</p>

    <h1>Demographic of WestAfrica</h1>
    West Africa or Western Africa is the westernmost region of Africa. The
          United Nations defines Western Africa as the 16 countries of Benin,
          Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau,
          Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal,
          Sierra Leone, and Togo, as well as Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan
          da Cunha (United Kingdom Overseas Territory).[8][9] The population of
          West Africa is estimated at 419 million[1][2] people as of 2021, and
          at 381,981,000 as of 2017, of which 189,672,000 were female and
          192,309,000 male.[3] The region is demographically[10] and
          economically[11] one of the fastest growing on the African continent.</p>
